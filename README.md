# Dynamics_of_Structures
MATLAB scripts to automate plotting of vibration experiment data (acceleration, displacement, frequency spectrum, and force-time responses) from Excel files. The repository contains plotting utilities for analyzing results from free vibration experiments using both initial displacement and initial velocity methods.
# Vibration Experiment Data Plotter

This repository contains MATLAB scripts to plot and analyze responses from vibration experiments.  
It reads data directly from Excel sheets and generates labeled plots for acceleration, displacement, frequency spectrum, and force-time responses.

## ðŸ“‚ Files

- `Initial velocity.xlsx` â€” contains experiment data for the **Initial Velocity method**.
- `Initial Displacement.xlsx` â€” contains experiment data for the **Initial Displacement method**.
- `plot_experiments.m` â€” MATLAB script to generate all plots automatically.

## ðŸš€ Features

- Reads multiple sheets from Excel files (`.xlsx`).
- Auto-labels axes and titles based on sheet type.
- Plots acceleration response, displacement response, frequency spectrum, and force vs time.
- Automatically adds grid and legend to each plot.
