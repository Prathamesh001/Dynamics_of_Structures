# Dynamics_of_Structures
MATLAB scripts to automate plotting of vibration experiment data (acceleration, displacement, frequency spectrum, and force-time responses) from Excel files. The repository contains plotting utilities for analyzing results from free vibration experiments using both initial displacement and initial velocity methods.
